# Learning Resources
The links below are split into different categories to make it easier to find exactly what you're looking for! All tools listed are free. For the most part, they are also multplatform (Windows, Mac, Linux) unless otherwise noted.

### Code Editors
Code editors are a tool you can use to write code. For the most part, they all work exactly the same so it doesn't matter which one you decide to use. You may chose one because you like the colors better or because it's easier to set-up -- it's completely up to you!

- [Sublime Text 3](https://sublimetext.com/3/): Occassionally you'll see a pop notification to buy it. Just press cancel -- it is free.
- [Atom](https://atom.io): It's very similar to Sublime and also free. It makes no difference whether you use Atom or Sublime.

You'll also want to practice your typing skills, as typing code requires use of the entire keyboard. Here's a fun and simple tool to help: https://typing.io/

### Advanced Code Editors: IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
Similar to code editors, IDEs are more sophisticated tools for writing code. While using a tool like Sublime will require that you also open a separate window for the Terminal and/or browser, an IDE has all of those things built in and much more.

I highly encourage you to try learning to code with an IDE. It makes developing programs easier by combining multiple tools into a single interface.

- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download): Python code editor only.
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages): Java, Javascript, C/C++, HTML, CSS, PHP
- [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/): Multi-language support.

### Learning Tools and Packages
You'll eventually need more than a code editor or IDE so that you can save your work and collaborate with others. Here are some additional tools you can look into as you need them.
- [Github](https://github.com): The most popular cloud repository in tech, Github allows you to upload all of your files to the cloud for free, but you'll need a quick introduction to how it works: 
  * [Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1): The best and fastest online git tutorial!
  * [Official Git Website](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial): More in-depth documentation about git and how it works.
- Command Line: You'll be using the Terminal (command line, aka CLI) more and more as you learn to code. Here are some great introductions to it.
  * [Mac Terminal](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)
  * [Windows Shell](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/)
  * [Linux Terminal](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595)
